// The honest, self-declared feature set of a connected radio, produced by an
// IRadioBackend and surfaced to clients (aetherd RFC §4.1 `welcome`). Clients
// render against what the radio *reports* — a control the radio lacks is
// disabled/absent — instead of hard-coding "the radio is a Flex". This is the
// structural replacement for the model-impersonation anti-pattern (RFC §1).
//
// Design (RFC §5.5 open-question Q1): a TYPED struct for the core profile —
// the surface every radio family has — plus a namespaced `extensions` bag for
// vendor-specific capability values that don't belong in the core. Typed where
// it's universal, open where it's vendor.
//
// NOT the same as models/ModelCapabilities: that is model-string-*derived*
// truth (a static FlexLib platform table keyed by the model name, Principle I);
// this is the radio's *reported* self-description produced by a backend and
// surfaced to clients. A FlexBackend may seed this FROM ModelCapabilities, but
// the two are distinct concepts (derived-from-name vs reported-by-backend).
//
// ADDING A FIELD: every field below defaults to false/0/empty, so a backend
// that omits one silently declares the feature ABSENT — set it explicitly in
// FlexBackend, Hl2Backend AND SimBackend. Then record it in
// docs/architecture/radio-capabilities-map.md, which maps every field to the
// code that reads it (and lists the ones nothing reads yet). A capability no
// consumer reads looks identical, from here, to one that works.
