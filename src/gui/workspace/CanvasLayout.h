// The set of items on one canvas surface, and the rules that keep it coherent
// (RFC #4887, phase 1).
//
// Widget-free by design.  Everything a canvas does that can be got wrong —
// clamping placement, deciding what is under the cursor, keeping stacking
// order sane — lives here so it is testable headless, leaving WorkspaceCanvas
// as a thin widget that only applies the answers.  See
// tests/workspace_layout_test.cpp.
//
// Item counts are in the tens (26 applets + up to 8 pans), so lookup is a
// linear scan over a QList.  A hash keyed by id would win nothing measurable
// and would cost the stable insertion order that makes the tests readable.

    // Rejects an empty or duplicate id: identity is what every other call
    // here takes as an argument, so letting a second "applet:RX" in would
    // make every later lookup ambiguous rather than merely wrong.  The item's
    // z is assigned on insert (topmost) and its rect clamped, so a caller
    // cannot introduce an off-canvas or buried item by construction.
    //
    // For a NEW item this is what you want — it belongs where the operator can
    // see it.  To rehydrate a SAVED arrangement, use restoreItems(): the
    // stored z is meaningful there and this call would discard it.
    bool addItem(CanvasItem item, const QSize& canvas);

    // Rehydrate a whole saved surface at once.
    //
    // WorkspaceDocument persists z per item, and once an operator has raised
    // anything, z no longer matches array order — so feeding stored items to
    // addItem() would silently restore the arrangement with its stacking
    // scrambled (PR #4900 review).  This sorts by stored z, inserts
    // bottom-to-top, and densifies once at the end.
    //
    // It takes the whole set rather than offering a per-item "preserve z"
    // flag because densifying after each insert would flatten the very
    // ordering it was given: two items whose stored z differ by 2 both
    // normalise to adjacent ranks, and the next insert can no longer tell
    // which was on top.  The batch is the only shape that cannot get that
    // wrong.

    // were inserted.

    // Topmost item containing the point, in canvas fractions; empty when the
    // point is over bare canvas.  Overlap is legal (items layer), so "topmost"
    // is the whole answer: the highest z wins, which is what the operator sees
    // and therefore what they expect to click.

    // ── Stacking ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // z values stay dense and contiguous over [0, count-1] after every one of
    // these.  Sparse or duplicated z is the bug that makes "raise" stop doing
    // anything after enough operations, so the invariant is restored eagerly
    // rather than checked for.
    //
    // Each returns TRUE ONLY IF THE STACKING ACTUALLY CHANGED — false for an
    // unknown id, and false for an item already at that end.  Callers turn
    // these into change notifications, and under auto-commit a notification
    // is a whole-document write: raising an already-frontmost item on every
    // mouse press would write the document on every click (PR #4900 review,
    // M2).  Use contains() if you need to tell "no such item" from "no-op".
