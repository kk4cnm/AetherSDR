// The workspace document — every workspace profile, the active selection, and
// the radio-profile bindings, as one versioned object (RFC #4887, phase 2).
//
// One document, one owner, one atomic write: Constitution Principle V (a
// feature owns its configuration as a single object) and Principle XIV
// (persist atomically).  That is the whole point of this type existing.  The
// arrangement it replaces is spread across a dozen independent settings keys
// with three different schemas and no single writer, so a shutdown path that
// skips one of them restores a MIXTURE of two layouts — which is what "the
// window rules never work" feels like from the operator's chair.
//
// Two things this schema deliberately separates:
//
//   * item rects are AUTHORITATIVE — fractions of their surface, restored
//     exactly, on every platform, every launch;
//   * `windowGeometry` on an extra canvas window is a HINT, and named like
//     one — the desktop may decline it, and always does on Wayland for
//     position.  A hint that is ignored costs one drag and loses no layout.
//
// Parsing is strict (Principle VII — untrusted input is validated at the
// boundary): the settings store is a file on disk that a user can edit, a
// backup can restore, and a future build can write a newer schema into.
//
// Widget-free, so the whole schema is unit-tested headless — see
// tests/workspace_document_test.cpp.
