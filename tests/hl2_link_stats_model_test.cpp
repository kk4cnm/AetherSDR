// The MODEL half of the HL2 link-stats seam — RadioModel driven by a real
// Hl2Backend against a fake HL2 on localhost.
//
// hl2_link_stats_test covers the backend side: that a transport snapshot is
// published on a cadence and that its numbers are real. Everything the OPERATOR
// actually sees is downstream of that, in RadioModel, and that half is where the
// interesting mistakes live — the seam can be perfect while every readout still
// lies. This pins the consumer contract:
//
//   • the readouts leave their structural zero (the reported symptom: a radio
//     streaming happily while the pane showed 0 packets, 0 bytes, "Off");
//   • a figure this transport cannot produce reads as ABSENT, and keeps reading
//     absent after the session ends — "no round trip to time" is a fact about
//     the wire, not about whether the wire is currently up;
//   • starting a scoring session forgets the PREVIOUS session's ping RTT, which
//     is the field the two reset paths drifted on;
//   • the heartbeat beats, and the status field is announced as Off on the
//     disconnect edge rather than freezing on the last quality the link had.
