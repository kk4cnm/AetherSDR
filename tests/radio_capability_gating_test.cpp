// Capability-gated UI surfaces: hasProfiles, hasDaxStreams, hasExtendedDsp,
// hasSupplyVoltageTelemetry, and the three status-bar toggles
// (hasRadioSideCwKeyer / hasVoiceKeyer / hasFullDuplex).
//
// The rule these guard (RadioCapabilities.h header comment, aetherd RFC §1) is
// that no call site asks "is this a Flex". A surface is gated on a DECLARED
// CAPABILITY named for the concept, so every check below reads a capability —
// never caps.family, and never a dynamic_cast to a backend type. A test that
// asserted the family would pass just as happily against the anti-pattern it
// exists to prevent.
//
// What is covered:
//   declaration   every backend sets every gated field EXPLICITLY. The struct
//                 defaults to false, so a backend that merely omits a field
//                 silently loses the feature — for Flex that is a regression,
//                 not a default. Asserting Flex=true is the guard against it.
//   relay         RadioModel::capabilitiesChanged fires on the connect and
//                 disconnect edges carrying both. It is the only signal
//                 MainWindow::applyCapabilitiesToUi() binds to, so a missing
//                 emission means a gated surface never updates.
//   permissive    the `!connected || caps.hasX` rule the GUI applies. With no
//                 radio attached there is nothing to be honest about, and a
//                 PROF applet that stayed hidden after unplugging reads as a
//                 fault. Evaluated here exactly as the GUI evaluates it.
//   supply volts  hasSupplyVoltageTelemetry gates the status bar's PA supply
//                 voltage readout. The label it hides is fed from the
//                 Flex-named "+13.8A" meter but repainted whenever PA
//                 TEMPERATURE changes, so a radio reporting only PA temp
//                 renders the 0.0f initialiser as a two-decimal measurement.
//                 Asserted on the CAPABILITY, so this stays true of any future
//                 family that reports no supply rail.
//   radio DSP     hasRadioSideDsp gates the radio's own NR/NB/ANF/NRL/ANFL/
//                 ANFT, the APD row and the WNB row. It must NOT gate the
//                 host-side equivalents — the AetherDSP modules and the
//                 Aetherial RX/TX EQ — which are the only audio DSP an operator
//                 has on a radio reporting false. The 8-band EQ applet was on
//                 this list until #4609 mapped its octave bands onto ClientEq
//                 for any backend without a Flex command plane; the control is
//                 no longer empty there, so it is no longer gated. WHICH of the
//                 two surfaces onto that shared ClientEq/ClientComp may write is
//                 a separate question, answered by core/HostVoiceChainPolicy.h
//                 and pinned by tests/host_voice_chain_policy_test.cpp.
//                 Asserted independent of
//                 hasExtendedDsp — the base set and the extra 8000-series
//                 filters are two different statements about a radio.
//   wf auto-black hasRadioSideWaterfallAutoBlack gates ONLY the HW position of
//                 the Display > Black Level button — the radio's per-tile level
//                 embedded in the waterfall stream. It must NOT gate the SW
//                 estimate, which is the only automatic floor an operator has
//                 on a radio reporting false, and it must go permissive on
//                 disconnect or the mask could never restore a stashed HW
//                 intent (docs/architecture/radio-capabilities-map.md). (#4606)
//   status bar    the CWX / DVK / FDX labels are HIDDEN, not dimmed, on a radio
//                 whose firmware runs none of those verbs. Three separate flags
//                 rather than one ride on hasRadioSideDsp, because a family
//                 could plausibly have a voice keyer without full duplex. TWO
//                 neighbours in that row are NOT gated: ASR, because Copy
//                 Assist runs whisper on this host off the engine's post-DSP RX
//                 audio, and TNF, because a host-side notch is landing and the
//                 TNF / +TNF surfaces are what it will drive — gating either
//                 would remove a control that works or is about to (the
//                 EQ-applet mistake, one row over). The keyer F1-F12 SHORTCUTS
//                 carry the same two flags as their buttons: an
//                 ApplicationShortcut stays armed whether or not its label is
//                 on screen. hasVoiceKeyer is evaluated AHEAD of the SmartSDR+
//                 entitlement gate, which fails open on an unknown license
//                 (#4210) and would otherwise leave DVK live on every radio
//                 that reports none at all. Both flags are read through
//                 RadioModel::hasRadioSideCwKeyer() / hasVoiceKeyer(), because
//                 the `cwx` verb has six more entry points than the buttons —
//                 the FlexControl/Ulanzi macro action, the MQTT cw/transmit
//                 topic, TCI cw_msg / cw_macros, rigctl send_morse / stop_morse,
//                 SmartCAT KY and the bridge's `cwx` verb — and all of them ask
//                 the accessor.
//
// A NOTE ON WHAT THE HELPERS BELOW DO AND DO NOT PIN. This target links
// aethercore, not the GUI (CMakeLists.txt), so nothing here can call
// MainWindow::applyCapabilitiesToUi() or updateKeyerAvailability() directly.
// uiWouldShow() is therefore a MIRROR of the visibility expression and pins
// nothing on the MainWindow side — deleting a `caps.x &&` there leaves this
// green. What IS pinned for real: every backend's declaration, and, for the two
// keyers, the RadioModel accessor the gate is built on, which the shortcut
// helpers call rather than paraphrase.
//   extended DSP  hasExtendedDspFilters() resolves through the BACKEND while
//                 connected and falls back to the model-name table when not,
//                 with Flex's answer unchanged on both routes.
//
// The connected-backend assertions run against SimBackend over the synthetic
// demo connection (RFC #4288): a demo RadioInfo takes RadioConnection's
// no-socket path, so isConnected() genuinely becomes true with no hardware and
// no network. That matters — the `!connected ||` half of the permissive rule is
// only meaningful if some case actually reaches the connected branch.
//
// Deliberately not covered here: the widget calls themselves
// (AppletPanel::setProfilesVisible / setDaxStreamsVisible, the menu actions).
// Those sit behind the full GUI link, which no test target takes; they are a
// one-line mapping off the values asserted below, proven on the running app
// with the automation bridge.
